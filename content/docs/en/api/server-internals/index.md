# Hytale Server Internal Documentation

<div className="version-badge">
  <span className="badge badge--warning">Version 2.0 - Experimental Documentation</span>
</div>

:::info Documentation v2 - Multi-Agent Verified

This documentation was generated using a multi-agent analysis system that:

- Extracts data directly from decompiled server source code
- Verifies all findings with source file references and line numbers
- Includes real code snippets from the actual codebase
- Uses anti-hallucination measures to prevent Minecraft/Bukkit pattern confusion

:::

## What is This Documentation?

This documentation reveals how the Hytale server works **under the hood**. While the official Hytale modding tools provide a user-friendly interface for creating content, understanding the server's internal systems gives you the power to create more sophisticated and performant modifications.

## What's New in v2

- **Accurate Event System**: 50+ events documented with real interfaces (IEvent, IAsyncEvent, ICancellable)
- **Complete Command System**: AbstractCommand hierarchy, argument types, registration methods
- **Network Protocol**: QUIC/UDP protocol, 268 packets, connection flow documentation
- **Plugin API**: Accurate lifecycle methods (preLoad, setup, start, shutdown), registries
- **Source References**: Every class and method includes source file paths and line numbers
- **Code Examples**: Real code from BlockTickPlugin, BlockSpawnerPlugin, and other builtin plugins

### Who is This For?

- **Plugin developers** who want to extend Hytale beyond what's possible with visual tools
- **Mod creators** who need fine-grained control over game mechanics
- **Technical enthusiasts** curious about how a modern game server is architected
- **Content creators** who want to understand the "why" behind game behaviors

### Why Learn Server Internals?

Think of the Hytale server as a car engine. You can drive a car without knowing how the engine works, but a mechanic who understands the engine can:
- Diagnose problems faster
- Optimize performance
- Add custom modifications
- Push the limits of what's possible

Similarly, understanding server internals allows you to:
- **Debug issues** by tracing exactly what happens when a player places a block or takes damage
- **Optimize performance** by knowing which systems are expensive and how to minimize their impact
- **Create unique gameplay** by hooking into systems that aren't exposed through normal APIs
- **Avoid common pitfalls** by understanding why certain patterns work and others don't

## About This Documentation

This section documents the **internal mechanisms** of the Hytale server, intended for advanced plugin developers who want to understand the server's inner workings.

### Sources

- Decompiled Hytale server source code (Early Access version)
- Automated analysis with manual verification
- Main package: `com.hypixel.hytale`

## Server Architecture

The Hytale server is built on a modular architecture based on:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ECS (Entity Component System)** | High-performance entity management system |
| **EventBus** | Synchronous and asynchronous event bus |
| **PluginManager** | Plugin manager with complete lifecycle |
| **QUIC Protocol** | Network communication via Netty + QUIC (port 5520) |
