eventBus.register(PlayerCraftEvent.class, event -> {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    CraftingRecipe recipe = event.getCraftedRecipe();
    int quantity = event.getQuantity();

    // Log the crafting action
    logger.info(player.getName() + " crafted " + quantity + "x " + recipe.getOutputItem());

    // Track crafting statistics
    incrementCraftingStats(player, recipe, quantity);

    // Award crafting experience
    awardCraftingXP(player, recipe);

    // Check for crafting achievements
    checkCraftingAchievements(player, recipe);
});

// Crafting tutorial system
eventBus.register(PlayerCraftEvent.class, event -> {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    CraftingRecipe recipe = event.getCraftedRecipe();

    // Track first-time crafts for tutorials
    if (isFirstTimeCrafting(player, recipe)) {
        showCraftingTutorial(player, recipe);
        markRecipeAsLearned(player, recipe);
    }
});

// Quest tracking
eventBus.register(PlayerCraftEvent.class, event -> {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    CraftingRecipe recipe = event.getCraftedRecipe();
    int quantity = event.getQuantity();

    // Update quest progress
    updateQuestProgress(player, "craft", recipe.getId(), quantity);
});
```

## Common Use Cases

- Tracking crafting statistics
- Awarding crafting experience points
- Checking for crafting achievements
- Quest progress tracking
- Logging crafting activity
- Tutorial systems for first-time crafts

## Migration Guide

This event is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Migrate to using `CraftRecipeEvent` from the ECS event system:

```java
// Old approach (deprecated)
eventBus.register(PlayerCraftEvent.class, event -> {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    CraftingRecipe recipe = event.getCraftedRecipe();
    // Handle crafting
});

// New approach using ECS events
// CraftRecipeEvent.Pre - cancellable, fires before crafting
// CraftRecipeEvent.Post - fires after crafting completes
```

- [LivingEntityInventoryChangeEvent](../entity/living-entity-inventory-change-event.md) - For tracking inventory changes

## Notes

Since this event is not cancellable, you cannot prevent crafting through this event. If you need to prevent or modify crafting behavior, use `CraftRecipeEvent.Pre` from the ECS system instead, which implements `ICancellableEcsEvent`.

The deprecation annotation includes `forRemoval = true`, indicating this event will be removed in a future version. Plan your migration accordingly.
