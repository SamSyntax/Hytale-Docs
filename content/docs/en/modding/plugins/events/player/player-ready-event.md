## Usage Example

```java
// Register a handler for when players are fully ready
eventBus.register(PlayerReadyEvent.class, event -> {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    int readyId = event.getReadyId();

    // Player is now ready to receive gameplay data
    logger.info("Player " + player.getName() + " is ready (readyId: " + readyId + ")");

    // Send welcome message
    player.sendMessage("Welcome to the server!");

    // Initialize player-specific systems that require a ready client
    initializePlayerUI(player);
    sendInitialInventory(player);
    showTutorialIfFirstTime(player);
});

// Start player-specific timers after they're ready
eventBus.register(PlayerReadyEvent.class, event -> {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();

    // Start AFK timer
    startAfkTimer(player);

    // Begin periodic stat updates
    scheduleStatUpdates(player);
});

// Trigger server-side logic that depends on client readiness
eventBus.register(PlayerReadyEvent.class, event -> {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();

    // Now safe to sync complex state to the client
    syncPlayerQuests(player);
    syncPlayerAchievements(player);
    syncPlayerFriendsList(player);
});

// Handle different ready states
eventBus.register(PlayerReadyEvent.class, event -> {
    int readyId = event.getReadyId();
    Player player = event.getPlayer();

    switch (readyId) {
        case 1:
            // Initial ready state
            handleInitialReady(player);
            break;
        case 2:
            // Subsequent ready (e.g., after world change)
            handleWorldChangeReady(player);
            break;
        default:
            logger.debug("Unknown readyId: " + readyId);
    }
});
```

## Common Use Cases

- Sending welcome messages after client is ready
- Initializing player UI elements
- Starting client-dependent timers or tasks
- Syncing complex state that requires a loaded client
- Triggering tutorials or first-time player experiences
- Beginning real-time updates that the client can process
- Loading player-specific resources or configurations

## Related Events

- [PlayerConnectEvent](./player-connect-event.md) - Fired earlier when player first connects
- [PlayerDisconnectEvent](./player-disconnect-event.md) - Fired when player disconnects
- [AddPlayerToWorldEvent](./add-player-to-world-event.md) - Fired when player is added to a world

## Event Order

The typical order of player connection events is:

1. **PlayerSetupConnectEvent** - Early validation phase
2. **PlayerConnectEvent** - Player entity created
3. **AddPlayerToWorldEvent** - Player added to a world
4. **PlayerReadyEvent** - Client fully loaded and ready

## Notes

The `readyId` field can be used to differentiate between different types of ready states. For example:
- Initial connection readiness
- Readiness after a world transfer
- Readiness after respawning

This event is ideal for any operations that require the client to be fully initialized and capable of processing server data properly.
