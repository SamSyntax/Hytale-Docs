# Events Reference

The Hytale server uses a sophisticated event system that allows plugins to listen for and respond to various game actions. This reference provides comprehensive documentation for all available events, their interfaces, and how to use them effectively.

## Event System Architecture

Hytale's event system is built on two parallel hierarchies:

1. **IEvent Hierarchy** - Traditional event dispatch for general server events (player connections, world changes, permissions)
2. **EcsEvent Hierarchy** - Entity Component System events for gameplay mechanics (block interactions, inventory changes, combat)

Both systems support event priorities, cancellation (where applicable), and flexible registration patterns.

## Core Interfaces

### IBaseEvent

The root interface for all events in the Hytale event system. The generic `KeyType` parameter allows events to be keyed for selective dispatch.

```java
public interface IBaseEvent<KeyType> {
}
```

### IEvent

Interface for synchronous events that execute immediately on the main thread.

```java
public interface IEvent<KeyType> extends IBaseEvent<KeyType> {
}
```

### IAsyncEvent

Interface for asynchronous events that return `CompletableFuture` and can execute off the main thread.

```java
public interface IAsyncEvent<KeyType> extends IBaseEvent<KeyType> {
}
```

### ICancellable

Interface for events that can be cancelled to prevent their default behavior.

```java
public interface ICancellable {
   boolean isCancelled();
   void setCancelled(boolean cancelled);
}
```

### IProcessedEvent

Interface for events that track post-processing by handlers.

```java
public interface IProcessedEvent {
   void processEvent(@Nonnull String handlerName);
}
```

### EcsEvent

Base class for Entity Component System events, separate from the `IEvent` hierarchy.

```java
public abstract class EcsEvent {
   public EcsEvent() {
   }
}
```

### CancellableEcsEvent

Base class for ECS events that support cancellation.

```java
public abstract class CancellableEcsEvent extends EcsEvent implements ICancellableEcsEvent {
   private boolean cancelled = false;

   public boolean isCancelled() { ... }
   public void setCancelled(boolean cancelled) { ... }
}
```

## Event Priorities

Events are dispatched to handlers in priority order. Lower values run first.

| Priority | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `FIRST` | -21844 | Highest priority, runs first. Use for preprocessing. |
| `EARLY` | -10922 | High priority. Use for validation and early modifications. |
| `NORMAL` | 0 | Default priority. Use for standard event handling. |
| `LATE` | 10922 | Low priority. Use for reactions to modifications. |
| `LAST` | 21844 | Lowest priority, runs last. Use for logging and final processing. |

### Shutdown Event Constants

The `ShutdownEvent` also defines special priority constants for shutdown ordering:

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `DISCONNECT_PLAYERS` | -48 | Priority for disconnecting players during shutdown |
| `UNBIND_LISTENERS` | -40 | Priority for unbinding listeners during shutdown |
| `SHUTDOWN_WORLDS` | -32 | Priority for shutting down worlds during shutdown |

## Registration Methods

Events are registered via `EventBus.register()` methods. Registration returns an `EventRegistration` object that can be used to unregister later.

### Basic Registration

```java
// Register with default (NORMAL) priority
EventRegistration registration = eventBus.register(
    PlayerConnectEvent.class,
    event -> {
        Player player = event.getPlayer();
        // Handle connection
    }
);
```

### Registration with Priority

```java
// Using EventPriority enum
eventBus.register(
    EventPriority.EARLY,
    PlayerChatEvent.class,
    event -> {
        // Handle chat early in the chain
    }
);

// Using raw short value for custom priority
eventBus.register(
    (short) -5000,
    PlayerChatEvent.class,
    event -> {
        // Custom priority between EARLY and NORMAL
    }
);
```

### Key-Specific Registration

```java
// Register for events with a specific key
eventBus.register(
    PlayerReadyEvent.class,
    "my-ready-key",
    event -> {
        // Only handles PlayerReadyEvent with this specific key
    }
);
```

### Global Registration

```java
// Receive ALL events of a type, regardless of key
eventBus.registerGlobal(
    EventPriority.NORMAL,
    PlayerEvent.class,
    event -> {
        // Handles all PlayerEvent instances
    }
);
```

### Unhandled Registration

```java
// Receive events that had no other handlers
eventBus.registerUnhandled(
    PlayerConnectEvent.class,
    event -> {
        // Fallback handler when no others matched
    }
);
```

### Async Registration

```java
// Register async handler returning CompletableFuture
eventBus.registerAsync(
    PlayerChatEvent.class,
    event -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        // Async processing
        return event;
    })
);
```

### Unregistering

```java
// Store the registration
EventRegistration registration = eventBus.register(...);

// Later, unregister
registration.unregister();
```

## Best Practices

### Event Handler Guidelines

1. **Keep handlers fast** - Event handlers block the main thread (except async events). Offload heavy work to async tasks.

2. **Check cancellation** - Always check `isCancelled()` at the start of your handler if other plugins might cancel the event.

3. **Use appropriate priorities** - Use `FIRST` for validation, `NORMAL` for standard handling, `LAST` for logging.

4. **Unregister when done** - Store your `EventRegistration` and call `unregister()` when your plugin disables.

5. **Handle exceptions** - Wrap handler code in try-catch to prevent crashes from breaking other handlers.

### Cancellation Guidelines

1. **Cancel early** - Cancel events at `FIRST` or `EARLY` priority to prevent unnecessary processing.

2. **Respect cancellation** - Check `isCancelled()` and return early unless you have a specific reason to proceed.

3. **Document cancellation** - If your plugin cancels events, document why for server administrators.

4. **Don't uncancel without reason** - Avoid calling `setCancelled(false)` unless implementing override functionality.
