# Welcome to Hytale Developer Wiki

The **Hytale Developer Wiki** is your comprehensive resource for everything related to Hytale development - from creating your first mod to running production servers.

## What is Hytale?

Hytale is a sandbox RPG developed by Hypixel Studios that launched in Early Access on **January 13, 2026**. Built from the ground up with modding at its core, Hytale offers unprecedented customization possibilities.

After being [reacquired by its original founders](https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved) Simon Collins-Laflamme and Philippe Touchette in November 2025, the game was released with a commitment to community-driven development and full modding support from day one.

### Key Features for Developers

- **"One Community, One Client"**: All modifications run server-side - players join modded servers without installing anything ([Source](https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status))
- **Four Modding Categories**: Server Plugins (Java), Data Assets (JSON), Art Assets (Blockbench), and Visual Scripting
- **Data-Driven Content**: JSON-based asset system for blocks, items, NPCs, and world generation
- **Professional Tools**: Official [Blockbench plugin](https://github.com/JannisX11/hytale-blockbench-plugin), Asset Editor, and [Creative Mode tools](https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-creative-mode)
- **Open Source Server**: Server source code will be released 1-2 months post-launch
